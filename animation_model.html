					<p>Animation short film: I Saw the Light</p>
					<p>
						I wanted to create an immersive experience of a strange UFO encounter from a first-person POV, so I came up with this cliche but also kind of goofy idea of creating an UFO abduction scene. I wanted the viewers to follow the camera and truly feel the tension and fear in the environment.  By amplifying the sounds and carefully crafting the environment, my goal was to make the experience immersive and unsettling, heightening the sense of dread as they followed the camera through the unknown. <br>
						I was trying to emulate realistic camera movement as much as I could, as if an actual person was carrying the camera. I’ve always loved documentary-style films, so I leaned into that approach. There wasn’t a deep, symbolic idea behind the story; it was more about creating a pure POV experienxce and pulling it off effectively through first-person camera work.

					<p>Animation short film: Blessing of the Sea</p>
					<p>
						The effect or experience I aimed to create for the viewer of my work is a sense of wonder, connection, and emotional resonance. The journey from the water to the land represents overcoming obstacles and finding safety, which could resonate with viewers on a deeper, metaphorical level, so the overall experience is meant to be uplifting, leaving the viewer with a sense of peace. <br>
						The piece explores themes of connection, transformation, and protection through the meeting of two contrasting characters in a vast ocean. The bigger water creature’s transformation into a bubble and then a bird symbolizes adaptability and selflessness, as it helps the smaller character reach safety. On a personal note, I've always wanted to create a flying scene as a How to Train Your Dragon tribute, so I guess this is my way of doing that.

					<p>Animation short film: Pixel World</p>
					<p>
						What: I wanted to transform flat 2D game aesthetics into a 3D space, so I took some elements from Pac-Man and made a little scene that he can move through.<br>
						Why: When I first started to play around with the MASH network, I knew I had to do something with pixels. Throwing in effects and collisions just made sense, so I ended up with Pac-Man eating dots and apples, and smashing into walls in 3D. It was the perfect way to bring those retro vibes to life.
